# Classify Anything

A repository for generic classification algorithms.

## Introduction

Classification is a supervised learning technique used to categorize data into predefined classes or groups. This repository contains various algorithms that can be used for classification tasks across different domains, such as:

- Predicting whether an email is spam or not
- Classifying images into categories (e.g., dogs vs. cats)
- Diagnosing medical conditions based on patient data
- Predicting customer churn

## Algorithms

This repository includes implementations of popular classification algorithms, such as:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Neural Networks

These algorithms are designed to be easy to use and flexible, allowing for quick experimentation and application to various datasets!!

## Getting Started
